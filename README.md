## Summary of Findings

### Part 1: Heapsort Implementation and Analysis
- **Heapsort** was implemented using a **max-heap** to sort an array. The array was transformed into a max-heap, and then the largest element was repeatedly extracted.
- **Time Complexity**: Heapsort runs in **O(n log n)** in the best, worst, and average cases. It is consistent across input distributions (random, sorted, reverse-sorted), as the heap property needs to be maintained at each step.
- **Space Complexity**: Heapsort is an in-place sorting algorithm, requiring **O(1)** additional space.
- **Comparison**: Heapsort was empirically compared to **Quicksort** and **Merge Sort**. Quicksort showed the best average-case performance but degrades to **O(nÂ²)** in its worst case. Merge Sort performs consistently in **O(n log n)** but uses more space due to its merging step.

### Part 2: Priority Queue Implementation and Applications
- The priority queue was implemented using a **min-heap** structure, which allows efficient insertion, extraction, and priority adjustment of tasks.
- The `Task` class allows the definition of tasks with `task_id`, `priority`, `arrival_time`, and `deadline`.
- **Time complexity** for operations:
- **Insert**: O(log n) using heapify-up.
- **Extract Min**: O(log n) using heapify-down.
- **Decrease/Increase Key**: O(log n) as it adjusts the position of tasks in the heap.
- **Is Empty**: O(1) as it checks if the queue is empty.
- **Design Choices**: A list was chosen for the heap to allow efficient index-based operations, and a `min-heap` was used because it fits task scheduling requirements.
- **Test Output**: Tasks were inserted, extracted by priority, and modified, demonstrating correct priority queue behavior. The final sample output verified the correct extraction and queue status.

## Additional Information

This implementation is suitable for scheduling algorithms where tasks need to be processed based on priority, such as deadline scheduling. It is flexible enough to handle a variety of scheduling policies based on priority values.
